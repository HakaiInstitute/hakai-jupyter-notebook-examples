# What's for
From Jupyter notebook [website](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/What%20is%20the%20Jupyter%20Notebook.html#Introduction):

> The Jupyter Notebook is an interactive computing environment that enables users to author notebook documents that include: 
> - Live code 
> - Interactive widgets 
> - Plots 
> - Narrative text 
> - Equations 
> - Images 
> - Video

**Jupyter Notebooks are great for:**
* analysing data
* producing plots
* sharing data analysis

**Jupyter Notebooks are not good for:**
* Developing new tools/packages
* Debugging 

*See [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as example for such applications.*

# How to get started
You can easily get started right away by using directly [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) which is giving you access to a remote server computer with preinstalled lot of the most usefull python packages. You can always install other packages available either on Github or the pip python package manager.

## Install python 
There's multiple way to install a python environment, [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) or its minimal install [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) are a great place to start. Download and install the miniconda version that match your computer OS. Select one of the latest Python versions, ignore particularly the oldest python 2 versions.

## Install Jupyter Notebook
To install Jupyter, just type the following commands in your conda or python shell :
```python
conda install jupyter
```
or
```python
pip install jupyter
```

## Finally
Simply type in your conda or python shell
```python
jupyter notebook
```
